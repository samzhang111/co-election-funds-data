The Secretary of State website does not provide a structured database dump for candidates or for committees. The available bulk data downloads for campaign expenditures and donations are keyed on committee IDs, however, so without that data, we do not have a way to link any particular file with the name or campaign.

I sent the Secretary of State office an email requesting this data in structured format, and they responded that they do not provide that kind of service, and to use the search feature of their website.

So I downloaded all the candidates and committees available on their website!
